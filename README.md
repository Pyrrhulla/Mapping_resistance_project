This is a part of [RESISTANCE – Rebellion and Resistance in the Iberian Empires, 16th-19th centuries. EU Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme, Marie Skłodowska-Curie Grant Agreement n. 778076](http://www.resistance.uevora.pt)

A text project in shiny: https://alexandra-an.shinyapps.io/MappingResistance/ 

This project consists of two parts: 

**Map**

This part focuses on the spatial visualization of the revolutions and rebellions on the global historical level. 

The application board has the main part with the global map, which has two rendering options:

Firstly, a static historical maps, which can be chosen by a user. 

Secondly, a dynamic mapping, which is connected with a timeslider. Therefore, a map is changed in accordance with a chosen time period by the slider. The side part has three content filters -- participants, reasons, monarchy that specify a dataset for rendering on the map.

The selection options for the map contains as vector maps (DARIAH historical maps) as raster maps (Typus Orbius Terrarum). For the released version a raster map with more detailed historical borders of the Iberian territories will be added instead of general maps. 

IMPORTANT! At this moment a new WMS server for hosting custom raster maps is under construction.
